# XBlocks
A small, yet addicting 2D block building game developed in Python utilizing the Turtle module.

HOW TO PLAY

Go to "Releases".

If you don't have Python already installed, download the XBlocks Installer (For your respective OS, of course :))

If you do, however, download the XBlocks Vxxx (whatever the version number is) and execute the main.py file.


NOTE FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS

When you download the XBlocks Installer, there will be a .txt file guiding you through the installation process.
